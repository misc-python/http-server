# HTTP-SERVER
401python code 07 HTTP - Protocols


Group Members: Joyce Liao. Matthew Brown. Toby Huang


Version: 1.0.0


## OVERVIEW
We built a basic HTTP server using the the Python standard library. We installed the  package "cowpy", and created endpoints such as "GET /", "GET /cow?msg=text",and "POST /cow msg=text" that execute CRUD related commands to the online cowpy file.


## GETTING STARTED
To run this server, the user need to open server.py in the terminal and have the user(s) sending requests to http ":5000".


## ARCHITECTURE
First we start the server by running HTTPServer from the Python library. Then, we set up SimpleHTTPRequestHandler as a class, and branched into more detailed functions according to the url parsed path and parsed query.
